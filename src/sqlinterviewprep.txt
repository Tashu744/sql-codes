Q1 Mention some common SQL queries and their roles.
Answer: 
SELECT: Retrieves data from one or more tables.
INSERT: Adds new rows of data into a table.
UPDATE: Modifies existing data in a table.
DELETE: Removes rows of data from a table.
CREATE TABLE: Creates a new table in the database.
ALTER TABLE: Modifies an existing table's structure.

Q2 Where you can or should use a foreign key? Give an example.
Answer:
A foreign key is used to link two tables together. It is a field in one table that refers to the primary key in another table.
Example: In a database with tables for "Orders" and "Customers," the "Orders" table might have a foreign key "CustomerID" that links to the "Customers" table's primary key.
